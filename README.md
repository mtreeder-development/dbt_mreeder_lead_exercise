### README
1. How to setup environmnets - Follow fivetran, snowflake, and dbt guides.
2. Tradeoffs - I didn't get all the way through the exercise in the time allotted. I could have hacked together something just using sql in snowflake but thought it best to show the DBT framework for building out a more scalable solution.
3. Write-up with ideas for longer term ETL strategies/processes - https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/15BrwFV4pN3yrRn_5Jcq0R3OKAaYmluKe2twnnRyp02U/edit?usp=sharing
4. Final Thoughts - I would have liked more clarity on a final models intended audience and purpose. It was unclear to me if this exercise was meant to consolidate the three sources and then merge/enrich the salesforce data or simply to combine the 4.
                    Overall, a fun exercise just ran out of time to build anything substational outside of pulling in the stg views and consolidating the 3 source tabs into a single model.
